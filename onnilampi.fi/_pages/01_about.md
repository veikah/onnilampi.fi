## My studies
My educational history is quite complicated, I have not gone through the traditional High School system. Instead, I got myself a degree as a telecommunications technician while simultaneously completing the high school diploma. In January of 2013 I started studying in Metropolia Polytechnic. I quickly switched to Aalto University, where my studies began in September of 2013. Major in Communication technology, minor in various related subjects.

## My work history
My technicians degree contained 20 credits as a trainee in various jobs. I completed all of them with high praise. I also worked as a janitor in a local resident complex during High School. These took place in 2008-2011. After my 2nd stage degrees I spent one year in the Finnish Air Force Academy, in the electronic warfare division. After my military training I worked as a teacher in my former school, teaching various subjects during four months, such as electronics and math. Since May 2014, I've been working as a sales technician at Oy Senseware Ltd.
