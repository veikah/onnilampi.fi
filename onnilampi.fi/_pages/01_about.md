![Me](http://placehold.it/300x300)

## My studies
My educational history is quite complicated, I have not gone through the traditional High School system. Instead, I got myself a degree as a telecommunications technician while simultaneously completing the high school diploma. In January of 2013 I started studying in Metropolia Polytechnic. I quickly switched to Aalto University, where my studies began in September of 2013. Major in Communication technology, minor in various related subjects.

## My work history
My technicians degree contained 20 credits as a trainee in various jobs. I completed all of them with high praise. I also worked as a janitor in a local resident complex during High School. These took place in 2008-2011. After my 2nd stage degrees I started my military training in the Finnish Air Force Academy on 11.7.2011, in the Electronic warfare division. During the 362 days of service I attained the rank of a Corporal, with commemorated discharge papers. After my military training I worked as a teacher in my former school, teaching various subjects during four months, such as electronics and math. Since May 2014, I've been working as a sales technician at Oy Senseware Ltd.

## My skills
I'm fluent in Finnish and English, although some minor grammatical errors may pop up every now and then. My Swedish is a bit rusty so i don't prefer to communicate in that language. I have extensive knowledge in Windows- and \*nix-systems, although I highly prefer GNU+Linux-systems. I can program adequately with Python and C and I use git and LaTeX daily. I know a lot about networking and server maintenance, I've done those as a hobby of sorts for almost ten years. As this website shows, I'm not a web designer by any means. I also use various office-programs fluently, Microsoft Office for example.

## My hobbies and interests
My hobbies include board- and computer games, Magic the Gathering, electronics, and activity in various organizations. I also enjoy reading books, especially Science-Fiction. I also enjoy drinking good beer and eating well prepared meat. I've been a Boy Scout since 2001, currently acting as a troop leader. I'm also on the board of CEC and Walpuri.
