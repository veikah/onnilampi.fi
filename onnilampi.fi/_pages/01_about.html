<h2>My studies</h2>
My educational history is quite complicated, I have not gone through the traditional High School system. Instead, I got myself a degree as a telecommunications technician while simultaneously completing the high school diploma. In January of 2013 I started studying in Metropolia Polytechnic. I quickly switched to Aalto University, where my studies began in September of 2013. Major in Communication technology, minor in various related subjects.
