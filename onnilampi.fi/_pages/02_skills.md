## Technologies

I have extensive knowledge in Windows- and \*nix-systems, although I highly prefer GNU+Linux-systems. 
Technologies I'm productive with include:

* Python and C: I'm familiar with these ranging from small scriplets to large projects.
* Databases: I have good knowledge on SQL syntax.
* Git and LaTeX: I use both daily.
* Server software: I know Apache very well, I'm also familiar with nginx and lighttpd.
* Server maintenance: I have lots of experience with Debian-based server solutions. I have experience with DigitalOcean and AWS.
* Web design: At this point you must have already noticed that I'm not a web designer by any means.

## Other skills

I've done lots of stuff in various projects and from those I've learned the following skills:

* Project management: Managing goals and people is easy for me.
* Teaching: I'm very good at getting my point accross to other people and teaching about subjects I have knowledge about.
* Electronics: I've built electronics ranging from a blinking LED to a stereo amplifier.
