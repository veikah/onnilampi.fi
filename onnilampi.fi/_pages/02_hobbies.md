## My skills
I'm fluent in Finnish and English, although some minor grammatical errors may pop up every now and then. My Swedish is a bit rusty so i don't prefer to communicate in that language. I have extensive knowledge in Windows- and \*nix-systems, although I highly prefer GNU+Linux-systems. I can program adequately with Python and C and I use git and LaTeX daily. I know a lot about networking and server maintenance, I've done those as a hobby of sorts for almost ten years. As this website shows, I'm not a web designer by any means. I also use various office-programs fluently, Microsoft Office for example.


## My hobbies and interests
My hobbies include board- and computer games, Magic the Gathering, electronics, and activity in various organizations. I also enjoy reading books, especially Science-Fiction. I also enjoy drinking good beer and eating well prepared meat. I've been a Boy Scout since 2001, currently acting as a troop leader. I'm also on the board of CEC and Walpuri.
