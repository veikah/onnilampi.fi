Welcome to my blog. I don't have any particular purpose for this, just thought it would be nice to have an option to create blog posts to a site that doesn't look revolting. Depending on the subject, the language of a post may be finnish or english.

<br>
<br>
{% for post in site.posts %}
<time>{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</time> - <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a><br>
{% endfor %}
