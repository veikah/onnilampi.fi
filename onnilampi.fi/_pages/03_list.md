#### List of things I choose to boycott, mostly crappy pizza joints. Suggestions to this list can be made by making a pull request on github.
[Leppävaaran pizzapalvelu][lpp] - Motherfuckers raised prices on their shitty pizzas from 6€ to 7€. The quality-to-price ratio is all fucked up now. \\
[Onni pizzeria][onni-pizzeria] - Shitty pizza place with inaccurate delivery information. Not worthy of that name.\\
[Yle Kioski][yle-kioski] - Tabloid journalism funded with tax payer money. Is known to intentionally misinterpret things in favor of a scoop!\\
[Serla][serla] - Shitty sandpaper disguised as toiletpaper. Be careful with this one, it may try to [disguise][serla-disguise] itself.
